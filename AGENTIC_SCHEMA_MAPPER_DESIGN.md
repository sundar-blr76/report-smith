# Agentic Schema Mapper Design - Iterative Context Enhancement

## Your Brilliant Insight

> "With additional context, LLM could also auto-apply filters, i.e. records are milestoned, there is a status column, LLM could iteratively obtain additional context, and improve query completeness"

**This is the KEY to making this truly intelligent!** üéØ

## The Iterative Agentic Approach

### Traditional Static Mapping (Limited)
```
Query ‚Üí Semantic Search ‚Üí Pick Columns ‚Üí Done
```
**Problem**: Misses important context like:
- Milestoning (effective_date, end_date)
- Status flags (is_active, status = 'Active')
- Soft deletes (deleted_at IS NULL)
- Data quality filters (is_validated = true)

### Agentic Iterative Mapping (Intelligent)
```
Query ‚Üí Initial Search ‚Üí LLM Reviews ‚Üí 
  "I see milestone columns!" ‚Üí 
    Get Milestoning Rules ‚Üí 
      "I see status column!" ‚Üí 
        Get Status Values ‚Üí
          Apply Smart Filters ‚Üí 
            Validate Completeness ‚Üí Done
```

## Real-World Example: The Power of Iteration

### Query: "Show AUM for equity funds"

#### **Iteration 1: Initial Semantic Search**
```python
Entity: "equity funds"
Semantic Results:
  - funds.fund_type (0.88)
  - funds.total_aum (0.85)

# Basic mapping, but incomplete!
```

#### **Iteration 2: LLM Reviews Schema Context**
```python
LLM sees full funds table schema:
  - id
  - name
  - fund_type
  - total_aum
  - status ‚Üê "Hmm, there's a status column!"
  - inception_date
  - close_date ‚Üê "And a close_date! This might indicate active/closed funds"

LLM reasoning:
  "I see status and close_date columns. Let me check what these mean..."

Action: REQUEST MORE CONTEXT
  - What are valid status values?
  - What does close_date indicate?
  - Are there business rules for 'active' funds?
```

#### **Iteration 3: Get Status Context**
```python
Agent calls: get_dimension_values('funds', 'status')

Response:
  - Active (80% of records)
  - Closed (15% of records)
  - Suspended (5% of records)

Agent also gets: get_business_rules('funds')

Response:
  "Active funds: status = 'Active' AND close_date IS NULL"
  "Historical queries should include all statuses"
  "Default queries should filter to active funds only"

LLM reasoning:
  "User said 'Show AUM for equity funds' (present tense).
   They want current/active funds, not closed ones.
   I should auto-apply: WHERE status = 'Active' AND close_date IS NULL"
```

#### **Iteration 4: Check for Milestoning**
```python
LLM sees in schema:
  - effective_date ‚Üê "This looks like milestoning!"
  - end_date

Action: REQUEST MILESTONING RULES
  get_milestoning_info('funds')

Response:
  "funds table is milestoned:
   - effective_date: When record became effective
   - end_date: When record was superseded (NULL = current)
   - Current records: end_date IS NULL
   - Point-in-time query: effective_date <= @date AND 
                          (end_date IS NULL OR end_date > @date)"

LLM reasoning:
  "Funds are milestoned! User wants current data, so I need:
   WHERE end_date IS NULL"
```

#### **Iteration 5: Check for Related Filters**
```python
LLM checks: "Are there other filters I should consider?"

Reviews entity "equity funds":
  - Already have: fund_type filter
  - Check: Are there regional/currency considerations?
  
Action: GET SCHEMA METADATA
  get_column_metadata('funds', 'fund_type')

Response:
  "fund_type values: Equity Growth, Bond, Money Market, Balanced, etc.
   Common query patterns:
   - 'equity' matches: Equity Growth, Equity Income, Equity Value
   - Users often want multiple equity types, not just one"

LLM reasoning:
  "User said 'equity funds' (plural). They probably want ALL equity types.
   I should use: WHERE fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'"
```

#### **Iteration 6: Validate Completeness**
```python
LLM final validation:
  "Let me verify this query is complete..."

Checklist:
  ‚úì User wants: AUM for equity funds
  ‚úì Selected: funds.total_aum, funds.name
  ‚úì Filter: fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'
  ‚úì Active only: status = 'Active' AND close_date IS NULL
  ‚úì Current data: end_date IS NULL (milestoning)
  ‚úì Joins needed: None (single table)
  
Completeness: 95%
Missing: Should I include inception_date for context? ‚Üí Yes, useful!
```

#### **Final Result**
```sql
SELECT 
  f.name,
  f.fund_type,
  f.total_aum,
  f.inception_date
FROM funds f
WHERE f.fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'
  AND f.status = 'Active'
  AND f.close_date IS NULL
  AND f.end_date IS NULL  -- milestoning: current records only
ORDER BY f.total_aum DESC
```

**vs. Without Iteration (Naive):**
```sql
SELECT f.total_aum
FROM funds f
WHERE f.fund_type = 'Equity Growth'
-- Missing: status filter, closed funds included, historical records included!
-- Result: WRONG DATA!
```

## Architecture: Iterative Agentic Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
```python

### Phase 2: LLM as Decision Engine

```python
def _llm_decide_next_action(self, mapping, context):
    """
    LLM decides what information to request next.
    """

You are an intelligent database query agent iteratively building a complete query.

ITERATION: {context['iteration']}/{context['max_iterations']}
USER QUERY: {context['query']}

CURRENT MAPPING STATE:

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR:
- Tables identified: {mapping.tables}
- Columns selected: {mapping.columns}
- Filters applied: {mapping.filters}
- Business rules: {mapping.business_rules}
- Milestoning: {mapping.milestoning_info}

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
1. SEMANTIC_SEARCH - Search for entities in schema
2. GET_TABLE_SCHEMA - Get full schema for a table
3. GET_DIMENSION_VALUES - Get possible values for a dimension column
4. GET_BUSINESS_RULES - Get business rules for a table/domain
5. GET_MILESTONING_INFO - Check if table has temporal/milestone columns
6. CHECK_RELATIONSHIPS - Get join paths between tables
7. VALIDATE_COMPLETENESS - Check if mapping is complete and correct
8. COMPLETE - Mapping is complete, ready to generate SQL

YOUR TASK: Decide the NEXT action to improve query completeness.

Consider:
- Do I need to check for status/active filters?
- Are there milestone/effective date columns?
- Do I understand all dimension values?
- Are my filters correct and complete?
- Do I have all necessary columns for a meaningful result?
- Are there business rules I should apply?

Return JSON:

## Enhanced LLM Prompts with Iteration Context

### Iteration 1: Discovery
```python
"""
You are discovering what information you need to build a complete query.

Query: "Show AUM for equity funds"

Start by identifying:
1. What tables/columns might be relevant (use SEMANTIC_SEARCH)
2. Once you have tables, get their full schemas (GET_TABLE_SCHEMA)

What do you want to do first?
"""
```

### Iteration 2: Schema Analysis
```python
"""
You've identified table: funds

Full schema shows columns:
- id, name, fund_type, total_aum, status, close_date, 
  effective_date, end_date, ...

I see several columns that might need special handling:
- status: What values are valid?
- close_date: Does NULL mean open/active?
- effective_date/end_date: Is this milestoned data?

What should we investigate next?
"""
```

### Iteration 3: Business Rules
```python
"""
You requested business rules for 'funds' table.

Rules retrieved:
- Active funds: status='Active' AND close_date IS NULL
- Milestoning: end_date IS NULL for current records
- Query defaults: Most queries want active, current records

Given user query "Show AUM for equity funds":
- Should we auto-apply active filter?
- Should we filter to current milestones?

Decide and explain your reasoning.
"""
```

### Iteration 4: Validation
```python
"""
You've built this mapping:

SELECT: funds.name, funds.total_aum, funds.inception_date
FROM: funds
WHERE: 
  - fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'
  - status = 'Active'
  - close_date IS NULL
  - end_date IS NULL

Validate completeness:
‚úì Answers user question?
‚úì All necessary filters applied?
‚úì Any missing context columns?
‚úì Joins needed?
‚úì Aggregations correct?

Is this complete or do you need more information?
"""
```

## Benefits of Iterative Approach

### ‚úÖ **Auto-Applies Best Practices**

```python
Without Iteration:
  WHERE fund_type = 'Equity Growth'
  # Missing: status filter, could return closed funds!

With Iteration:
  WHERE fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'
    AND status = 'Active'
    AND close_date IS NULL
    AND end_date IS NULL
  # Complete: only active, current records
```

### ‚úÖ **Discovers Data Quality Rules**

```python
LLM discovers:
  - status column exists
  - Requests: What are valid values?
  - Learns: 'Active', 'Closed', 'Suspended'
  - Decides: User wants Active only
  - Applies: WHERE status = 'Active'
```

### ‚úÖ **Handles Temporal Complexity**

```python
LLM discovers:
  - effective_date and end_date columns
  - Requests: Is this milestoned?
  - Learns: Yes, SCD Type 2
  - Applies: WHERE end_date IS NULL (current records)
```

### ‚úÖ **Context-Aware Filtering**

```python
Query: "Show AUM for equity funds"

LLM reasons:
  - "equity funds" is plural
  - Should match ALL equity types
  - Uses: fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'
  
vs. Naive:
  - fund_type = 'Equity Growth' (just one type!)
```

### ‚úÖ **Adds Useful Context Columns**

```python
LLM decides:
  "User wants AUM data. They'll also want:
   - fund name (to identify funds)
   - inception_date (for context)
   - fund_type (to see what type)
   
Even though only 'AUM' was mentioned!"
```

## Configuration Enhancements

### Add Business Rules to YAML

```yaml
# config/applications/fund_accounting.yaml

tables:
  funds:
    name: funds
    description: Investment fund master data
    
    # Business rules for automatic application
    business_rules:
      default_filters:
        - condition: "status = 'Active'"
          reason: "Most queries want active funds only"
          auto_apply: true
          exceptions: ["historical", "audit", "all"]
        
        - condition: "close_date IS NULL"
          reason: "Exclude closed funds"
          auto_apply: true
          exceptions: ["historical", "closed"]
        
        - condition: "end_date IS NULL"
          reason: "Current milestone records only"
          auto_apply: true
          exceptions: ["historical", "point_in_time"]
      
      common_patterns:
        equity_funds: "fund_type LIKE 'Equity%'"
        bond_funds: "fund_type LIKE 'Bond%'"
        active_funds: "status = 'Active' AND close_date IS NULL"
        large_funds: "total_aum > 100000000"
    
    # Milestoning configuration
    milestoning:
      enabled: true
      type: "SCD_TYPE_2"
      effective_date_column: "effective_date"
      end_date_column: "end_date"
      current_record_filter: "end_date IS NULL"
    
    columns:
      status:
        type: varchar
        is_dimension: true
        description: "Fund status"
        values: ["Active", "Closed", "Suspended"]
        default_filter: "Active"
      
      close_date:
        type: date
        description: "Date fund was closed (NULL = open)"
        related_filter: "close_date IS NULL for active funds"

## Summary

Your insight about **iterative context enhancement** is the key to making this truly intelligent!

### The Magic Formula:
```
Smart Query = 
  Semantic Search (what matches?) +
  Full Schema Context (what exists?) +
  Business Rules (what's standard?) +
  Milestoning Rules (what's current?) +
  Dimension Knowledge (what values?) +
  LLM Reasoning (what makes sense?) +
  Iterative Refinement (what's missing?)
```

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Auto-applies best practices (status filters, milestoning)
- ‚úÖ Discovers data quality rules
- ‚úÖ Handles temporal complexity
- ‚úÖ Adds missing context columns
- ‚úÖ Validates completeness
- ‚úÖ Gets smarter over time

**Shall we start implementing this iterative agentic approach?** üöÄ
